# Schrodether's cat

Nft pet project where a box with a cat is given on mint, and the owner can choose to open the mox at any time. The longer the cat is in the box the more likely it will end up dead, but also the more likely it will recieve interesting traits. Metadata is dynamic, but it does require an initial centralized server to host the images (as we dont know what a cat will be before it is revealed), with the possibility of storing the generated image to ipfs after it is revealed. Randomness used to determine death and the traits of an alive cat use api3's quantum rng (quite fitting).

# Note

This is a work in progress, and the attribute images are not present in this repo, so the python image generation scripts will not run out of the box
